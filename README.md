Our goal is to utilize the Spotify API to analyze top tracks, albums, artists and genres to determine if their respective moods, defined by Spotify as things such as 'energy', 'danceability', etc, differ across different US states, countries and geographic regions of the world.  Thereafter, we will determine whether these mood differences are correlated with varying independent variables such as levels of crime, freedom, languages, etc.
