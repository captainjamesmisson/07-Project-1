# 07-Project-1

Our goal is to utilize the Spotify API to:

  - Analyze top tracks, albums, artists and genres to determine if their respective audio characteristics, defined by Spotify as things such as 'energy', 'danceability', 'length of song', etc, differ across different US states, countries and geographic regions of the world. 
  
  - Deterimine if characteristic differences are correlated with varying independent variables such as levels of crime, freedom,    languages, etc. across different different geographic regions.
  
  - Assess whether the aggregate/mean audio characteristics of the Billboard Top 100 songs have shown meaningful changes across time, going back as far as possible.
